### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

I'm not much of a coder but I've been doing some amateur-level stuff for fun and personal use. I do want to publish it all eventually in case anyone's got the same needs as me but I'm not too confident atm.

Mostly working on stuff in occasional bursts of inspiration.

Have dabbled in the following languages:
- Most recently, tried my hand in JavaScript and Lua.
- Worked on some Rainmeter skins during last year, mostly forks and edits of existing widgets and libraries.
- Modified a program written in OpenTuring a decade ago, haven't used it or looked at the code since.
- Originally learned coding on Pascal and C/C++, and studied assembler a bit, but I've got no memory of those now.
