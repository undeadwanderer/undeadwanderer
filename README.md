### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

I'm not much of a coder but I've been working on some amateur-level stuff for personal use. I do want to publish it all eventually in case anyone's got the same needs as me but I'm not too confident atm.

Mostly working on stuff in occasional bursts of inspiration.

Have dabbled in the following languages:
- Most recently, tried my hand in JavaScript and Lua.
- In the last year worked on some Rainmeter skins, mostly forks and edits of the existing ones.
- Modified a program written in OpenTuring a decade ago, haven't used it or looked at the code since.
- Originally learned coding on Pascal and C/C++ but I've got no memory of those now.
